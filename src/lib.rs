//! # Overview
//!
//! The Android file system is strict and complex because its behavior and the available APIs vary depending on the version.  
//! This plugin was created to provide explicit and consistent file operations.  
//! No special permission or configuration is required.  
//!
//! # Usage
//! There are three main ways to manipulate files:
//!
//! ### 1. Dialog
//! Opens the file picker to read and write user-selected files.
//!
//! ```
//! use tauri_plugin_android_fs::{AndroidFs, AndroidFsExt, VisualMediaTarget};
//!
//! fn read_files(app: tauri::AppHandle) {
//!     let api = app.android_fs();
//!     let selected_paths = api.show_open_file_dialog(&["*/*"], true).unwrap();
//!
//!     if selected_paths.is_empty() {
//!         // Handle cancellation
//!     }
//!     else {
//!         for path in selected_paths {
//!             let file_name = api.get_file_name(&path).unwrap();
//!             let file: std::fs::File = api.open_file(&path).unwrap();
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn write_file(app: tauri::AppHandle) {
//!     let api = app.android_fs();
//!     let selected_path = api.show_save_file_dialog("fileName", Some("image/png")).unwrap();
//!
//!     if let Some(path) = selected_path {
//!         let mut file: std::fs::File = api.open_file_writable(&path).unwrap();
//!     }
//!     else {
//!         // Handle cancellation
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### 2. Public Storage
//! File storage intended to be shared with other apps and user.
//!
//! ```
//! use tauri_plugin_android_fs::{AndroidFs, AndroidFsExt, PublicImageDir, PublicStorage};
//!
//! fn example(app: tauri::AppHandle) {
//!     let api = app.android_fs().public_storage();
//!     let contents: Vec<u8> = todo!();
//!
//!     api.write_image(
//!         PublicImageDir::Pictures,
//!         "myApp/2025-02-13.png",
//!         Some("image/png"),
//!         &contents
//!     ).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### 3. Private Storage
//! File storage intended for the appâ€™s use only.
//!
//! ```
//! use tauri_plugin_android_fs::{AndroidFs, AndroidFsExt, PrivateDir, PrivateStorage};
//!
//! fn example(app: tauri::AppHandle) {
//!     let api = app.android_fs().private_storage();
//!
//!     // Write data
//!     api.write(PrivateDir::Data, "config/data1.txt", "data").unwrap();
//!
//!     // Read data
//!     let data = api.read_to_string(PrivateDir::Data, "config/data1.txt").unwrap();
//!     assert_eq!(data, "data");
//! }
//! ```
